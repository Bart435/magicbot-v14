# MagicBot-v14


This was the bot being used by MagicArk.

It's now been made avialable to the world for other developers to use parts of it. 

As you can see, There's some decent and bad code in this. This is me progressing knowledge wise over the years. This shit is 4 years of stacking code on junky code. 

USE AT OWN RISK

No license attacked!
